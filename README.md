# Bunge Bits

[![Rust and Ui Checks](https://github.com/c12i/bunge-bits/actions/workflows/rust-and-ui-checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/c12i/bunge-bits/actions/workflows/rust-and-ui-checks.yml)

Bunge Bits provides convenient summaries of Kenyan National Assembly and Senate proceedings, making legislative information more accessible and digestible.

## Motivations

The driving force behind Bunge Bits is to strengthen Kenya's democracy by making legislative processes more transparent and understandable to all citizens. The aim is to bridge the gap between complex government proceedings and the average Kenyan, fostering increased civic engagement and political awareness. By offering concise, easy-to-digest summaries of legislative sessions, I hope to empower citizens with the knowledge they need to participate more fully in their democracy, hold elected officials accountable, and engage in informed discussions about the issues that affect their lives.

Ultimately, Bunge Bits seeks to contribute to a more engaged, informed, and participatory democratic process in Kenya.
